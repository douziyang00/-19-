# React project with Redux



### Why is Redux?

> You may not need Redux, if you'r not sure

I think you'r not need Redux in following.

There'r not a lot of communication between with components that haven't direct relation.It's mean  most component's state change will be happen in component .

Example, a list component have two status are  "sliding" and "pack up". The status will control by a button.They are belong to same parent and not exist deep nesting.This moment we will control status by child's props in parent instead of redux.

### How to add Redux support for create-react-app project!

##### Use yarn instead of NPM.

Beacuse NPM may remove existing node's modules,if you used NPM. The situation is mean you will must run NPM install again.It's not Elegant.

This command used for add Redux in your create-react-app

`yarn add react-redux & yarn add redux`
